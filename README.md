# Time-Series-Analysis-for-Transportation

Answer the following questions to help The League optimize their flight schedules, keeping the important things to know in mind.

We're interested in the maximum number of jets that The League needs to own. Create a time-series graph that shows how many teams will be “in flight” throughout the 2102 season. Use this graphic to tell us the maximum number of teams simultaneously in flight. Store these results in variables named max_teams_in_flight.

Use 2101's jet fuel prices to project jet fuel prices for 2102. Apply these projections to every flight taken by every team to determine the overall fuel spend for 2102. Store your result in a variable named total_fuel_spend_2102_dollars.
